\title{Assign structures to a list of elemental compositions (after extracting the number of each element)}
\usage{
assign_structures(
  c,
  h,
  o,
  n,
  p,
  na = NULL,
  cl = NULL,
  ion.mode,
  adducts = NULL,
  domain = "euk",
  lois = NULL,
  max.dbl.bnds = 14
)
}
\arguments{
\item{c, h, o, n, p}{lists (or dataframe columns) containing the numbers of each respective element in each respective composition (these should come from extract_num_elements() function).}

\item{na, cl}{lists (or dataframe columns) containing the numbers of each respective element in each respective composition. Default to zero.}

\item{ion.mode}{which ion mode the samples were run in. One of "neg.ion","pos.ion", or "neutral" ("neutral" searches for structures as exact compositions / neutral species).}

\item{adducts}{which ions/adducts to search for compositions as. Defaults to c("m.plus.h","m.plus.ammonia","m.plus.sodium") in positive ion mode, c("m.minus.h","m.plus.chloride","m.minus.2h") in negative ion mode, and the inclusive union of these two lists in neutral mode.}

\item{domain}{what domain of life the data originates from. "euk" for eukaryotic (default) or "bact" for bacterial.}

\item{lois}{which lipid classes to look for. Defaults to c("pc","sm","tag","dag") in positive ion mode, c("pe","cer","cl","pi","pg","pa","ps","ffa") in negative ion mode, and the inclusive union of these two lists in neutral mode.}

\item{max.dbl.bnds}{maximum number of acyl+alkyl chain double bonds allowed in returned structures. Defaults to 14.}
}
\description{
This function assigns general lipid structure (e.g. PC(32:1)) to a user-defined elemental composition (e.g. C40 H79 N O8 P), or a list/column of elemental compositions
